How do we calculate distance between points in a nonlinear space?

Football:
354lbs, 6'3"

Recruits:
200lbs, 6'4"
360, 6'10"
350, 5'3"


It's complicated...

If you are bored in a party ful lof AI nerds, ask them about distance measurements. It will start a fun fight.

3 Most common:
L1 - firstRoot(x^1 + y ^ 1 + z ^ 1 .... k ^1) => no need for first root.... |x| + |y| + |z|  ... |k|
L2 - Euclidean sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z ^2 ..... k^2)
LInfinity - infiniteRoot(x^inf + y^inf + z^inf ... k^inf) => infiniteRoot(Biggest(x...k)^infinity) => |biggest(x...k)|
