## Colors and Color Spaces

### RGB

Based on the cones in our eyes and inherited from television.

### HSV

Artist-friendly

How do we go from rgb to hsv and back?

First thing to know...HSV masquerades under 3 names. HSV, HSB, HSL.

What's the formula? Google it. It complicated. Since it's discontinuous it has several if statements.

## Two ways to think about color

Additive and subtractive

Digital art is additive, colors add up to white.

Traditional art is subtractive, colors subtract down to muddy brown.

## Color remapping

Photos don't alwas use all avaiable space in the spectrum. By filling the spectrum, the images should look better.
